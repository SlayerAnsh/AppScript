# Automated Mail
Automated mail can save so much time and at the same time gives users/customers a feeling that the organisation is not ignoring them.
## Batch Mail
Sending Batch mail but at the same time customised (like namefield) from google spreadsheet and that too without sharing your data to any other third party source. Just use appscript and copy paste the following code. Adjust some parameters and boom!. Select and mail.

## Form Submit Mail
Google forms provide a very good way to get responses from users. Be it a survey or webinar registration form, google form provides an easy yet strong way to do them. Now as an organiser of an event you will like to provide some detailed information to the user who has registered for the event. One way is to send Batch mail but it will take some time coz you will have to manually select the list (though mailing is completely automated).
But if somehow u can send the mail as soon as user submit the form, wouldn'y it be great? With this script you can send customised mail as soon as user submits a google form.
